Using intense, ultrafast laser pulses, the Femtosecond Spectroscopy Unit explores the optical properties of matter. Its members study graphene and other two-dimensional materials for their potential in transparent, flexible electronics; research semiconductors for photocatalytic and solar energy applications; and investigate applications of ultrafast laser pulses to biology and medicine.

Dear Dr. Dani,

I am writing to inquire about the possibility of an internship in your lab. As a high school student, I am eager to gain hands-on experience with scientific research in a lab environment.

I have been interested in your lab's work in marine biophysics. The local biology and environment of Okinawa means a lot to me. Inspired by your recent work on garden eels and coral larvae, I am keen to contribute in any way I can.

With a strong foundation in technical skills and a hardy work-ethic, I believe I can make a contribution to your ongoing research projects. I am a dedicated and detail-oriented individual, committed to collaboration and excellence.

I am available to intern for whenever is convenient for your team, and will be able to work with you until my academic year starts on August 22nd. I am flexible with scheduling and any guidelines or requirements you may have.

I have attached my resume/CV for your review, providing further details on my academic background, research experience, and skills. I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to discuss my potential contribution to your lab in person or online.

Thank you for considering my application. I am excited about the prospect of working with your research team and gaining valuable insight into what a professional scientific environment looks like.

Sincerely, 
Julian Hong
