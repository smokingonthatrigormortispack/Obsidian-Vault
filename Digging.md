Between my finger and my thumb     

The squat pen rests; snug as a gun.  

  

Under my window, a clean rasping sound     

When the spade sinks into gravelly ground:     

My father, digging. I look down  

  

Till his straining rump among the flowerbeds     

Bends low, comes up twenty years away     

Stooping in rhythm through potato drills     

Where he was digging.  

  

The coarse boot nestled on the lug, the shaft     

Against the inside knee was levered firmly.  

He rooted out tall tops, buried the bright edge deep  

To scatter new potatoes that we picked,  

Loving their cool hardness in our hands.  

  

By God, the old man could handle a spade.     

Just like his old man.  

  

My grandfather cut more turf in a day  

Than any other man on Toner’s bog.  

Once I carried him milk in a bottle  

Corked sloppily with paper. He straightened up  

To drink it, then fell to right away  

Nicking and slicing neatly, heaving sods  

Over his shoulder, going down and down  

For the good turf. Digging.  

  

The cold smell of potato mould, the squelch and slap  

Of soggy peat, the curt cuts of an edge  

Through living roots awaken in my head.  

But I’ve no spade to follow men like them.  

  

Between my finger and my thumb  

The squat pen rests.  

I’ll dig with it.
