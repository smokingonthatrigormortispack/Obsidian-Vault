The Memory Research Unit aims to understand how memories are encoded, retrieved and consolidated in the brain. Extensive evidence and theoretical works suggest unique roles for the hippocampus in these processes and propose that it mnemonically processes external and internal information. Nevertheless, the hippocampusâ€™ specific contribution remains unclear. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive view on the hippocampal role in memory. To this end, we use in vivo electrophysiology and Ca2+ imaging in freely moving mice combined with genetic labeling, manipulation, and tracing.

Subject: Request for Unpaid Science Lab Internship

Dear Dr. Tanaka,

I am writing to inquire about the possibility of an internship in your lab. As a high school student, I am eager to gain hands-on experience with scientific research in a lab environment.  
  
I have been interested in your lab's work in memory research. Growing up, I have always been fascinated with my father's work on the neuroscience of rats. Although it doesn't directly apply to my dream field, I see a lot of benefit towards working in your lab. I understand that as a high school student, there may not be much to offer. However, I'm willing to assist in any way I can, even if the only work I can do is menial labor.

With a strong foundation in technical skills and a hardy work-ethic, I believe I can make a contribution to your ongoing research projects. That being said, I understand that the lab environment is on a different level from anything I've previously worked in. I'm committed to learning more and growing both as a student of science and as a future member of the workforce.
  
I am available to intern whenever is convenient for your team, and will be able to work with you until my academic year starts on August 22nd. I am flexible with scheduling and any guidelines or requirements you may have.  
  
I have attached my resume/CV for your review, providing further details on my academic background, research experience, and skills. I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to discuss my potential contribution to your lab in person or online.  
  
Thank you for considering my application. I am excited about the prospect of working with your research team and gaining valuable insight into what a professional scientific environment looks like.  
  
Sincerely,  
Julian Hong
