### [[Summer Reading 2023]]

## Assignment 3: Choice Read #2
>In preparation for our first week of written analysis, you need to select one title off of the approved list and read it over summer. Some titles are very long, but others are quite short, so there is no reason not to complete this assignment! Overall, you are required to read two books this summer in preparation for the course. I urge you to read texts that are challenging, diverse, and different from what you normally read. You must choose a title off of the list of suggested titles or you can choose a different book if you receive permission from your English teacher in advance. Please do not re-read something or choose something below your reading level.

## One Pager Directions
>A one pager is a way to visually share key ideas and information from what you have learned. When you create a one pager, you are trying to use both visual symbols and important words to clearly and concisely share your most important takeaways with someone else.
>
>For this one pager, I've provided you with a template.
>
> **Here's what it MUST INCLUDE:**
> - A border of key quotations from the text
> - The top half should focus on symbolism and themes from the text, including both words and images.
> - The bottom half should focus on key characters from the text and how they develop, change, and interact. It should also include both words and images.
>
> **You may also add other symbols, drawings, and words that represent the reading as you wish.**
