## 250 word response:

The role of a great poem is to express, to take something that can't be put into words and put it in prose. Be it culture, emotion, or experience, great poetry can use wordplay and literary tools to bring a more vivid experience than any painting, song, or film. Great poetry respects the reader's ability to imagine and pick up on the nuance of every word. A movie may show you a scene, but a poem forces you to imagine it, thereby allowing you to feel it viscerally.

Digging expresses these qualities to a T. Heaney uses poetry to reflect on his ancestry, his forbearers and the land they toiled. He reflects on his departure from this ancestry, choosing to take up a pen rather than a shovel. Through his use of wording and rhythm, we are given an intimate understanding of his situation and his emotions. This is the mark of a great poem.

Another poet that exemplifies these qualities is the Compton born rapper Kendrick Lamar Duckworth. Just like Seamus Heaney, Lamar masterfully uses imagery and word choice to depict the struggles of his people and the emotions he feels as a result. The vitriolic rage of "The Blacker the Berry," the melancholic contemplation of mortality and violence in "Sing about Me, I'm Dying of Thirst," and exploration of the crimes of great artists/heros in "Prayer," are all only as impactful as they are because of Lamar's intricate writing and his expectations of the listener to keep up with his lyrical acumen. These are the marks of a great poet.
