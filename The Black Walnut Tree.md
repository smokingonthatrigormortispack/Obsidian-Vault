By Mary Oliver

My mother and I debate:  
we could sell  
the black walnut tree  
to the lumberman,  
and pay off the mortgage.  
Likely some storm anyway  
will churn down its dark boughs,  
smashing the house. We talk  
slowly, two women trying  
in a difficult time to be wise.  
Roots in the cellar drains,  
I say, and she replies  
that the leaves are getting heavier  
every year, and the fruit  
harder to gather away.  
But something brighter than money  
moves in our blood–an edge  
sharp and quick as a trowel  
that wants us to dig and sow.  
So we talk, but we don't do  
anything. That night I dream  
of my fathers out of Bohemia  
filling the blue fields  
of fresh and generous Ohio  
with leaves and vines and orchards.  
What my mother and I both know  
is that we'd crawl with shame  
in the emptiness we'd made  
in our own and our fathers' backyard.  
So the black walnut tree  
swings through another year  
of sun and leaping winds,  
of leaves and bounding fruit,  
and, month after month, the whip-  
crack of the mortgage.

## Summary

‘_The Black Walnut Tree’_ by Mary Oliver is an autobiographical poem that describes the pros and cons of selling an important black walnut tree.

In the first lines of this poem, the [speaker](https://poemanalysis.com/diction/speaker-in-poetry/) begins by telling the reader that she and her mother are debating selling the black walnut tree on their property. They spend time talking through the pros of this sale. It’s an old tree, likely to fall onto the house, and is often overburdened with fruit. The roots have made their way into the basement drains as well. But, there’s something that keeps them from making the sale, despite the fact that they could pay off the mortgage with the money. 

The tree represents their family heritage and the handwork their ancestors did to establish a home there. The speaker has a dream about her “fathers,” who emigrated from Europe to work in Ohio. This helps solidify the fact that if they cut the tree down, they’d have to deal with unshakeable shame. So, it seems the two decide to keep the tree, at least for the time being.

## Detailed Analysis 

### Lines 1-15

> My mother and I debate:
> 
> we could sell
>

> 
> to the lumberman,
> 
> and pay off the mortgage.
>

> harder to gather away.

In the first lines of _‘The Black Walnut Tree,’_ the speaker begins by telling the reader that there is a debate going on. It’s occurring between the speaker, a woman whose usually considered to be Mary Oliver, and his mother. They’re trying to figure out whether they should sell the black walnut tree. They are “two women,” as line eight reveals, and they know that they need the money.

With the money, they could “pay off the mortgage.” Over the next few lines, the poet lays out why the speaker and her mother think it’s a good idea to go ahead and sell the tree. It’s inconvenient, likely to fall down anyway and smash the house, and the “leaves are getting heavier,” and the fruit is hard to gather. 

It’s in these first fifteen lines that the two talk about what the problems with the tree are. They are the pros of selling the tree. But, as the following section of the poem is introduced, it becomes clear that there are far more cons to selling it. Throughout these lines, and those which follow, Oliver sues a conversational, matter-of-fact [tone](https://poemanalysis.com/definition/tone/). The speaker and the mother are truly debating both sides, using normal, everyday language. 

### Lines 16-25

> But something brighter than money
> 
> moves in our blood–an edge
> 
> sharp and quick as a trowel
> 
> (…)
> 
> of fresh and generous Ohio
> 
> with leaves and vines and orchards.

In the next few lines of the poem, the speaker brings in all the reasons why they shouldn’t get rid of the tree. There is something far more important than money to consider. It is “brighter” and “moves in our blood.” This “thing” is the ancestry, history, and heritage the tree represents. It is “sharp and quick as a trowel / that wants us to dig and sow.” This refers back to the history of the land and the establishment of roots. The two know that by getting rid of the tree, they would be dishonoring and forgetting the work of their ancestors.

After their talk, the speaker dreams of the past and of her “fathers” out working in the fields. The plural “fathers” represents all of her forefathers, dating back to the first relative that came to North America and then Ohio. The lines in this part of the poem are a great example of [imagery](https://poemanalysis.com/figurative-language/imagery/). The color stands out exceptionally well. 

### Lines 26-35

> What my mother and I both know
> 
> is that we’d crawl with shame
> 
> in the emptiness we’d made
> 
> (…)
> 
> and, month after month, the whip-
> 
> crack of the mortgage.

In the final lines of _‘The Black Walnut Tree,’_ the speaker says that she and her mother know they’d be filled with shame if they got rid of the tree. It would fill up their yard and “our fathers’ backyard.” So, the tree stays for the time. It continues to move in the wind, drop fruit. These images are accompanied by the “whip- / crack” of the mortgage that still hasn’t been resolved.
