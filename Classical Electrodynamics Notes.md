# Chapter 1: Introduction and Survey
- [[Cavendish]]'s experiments on electrostatics between 1771 and 1773
- [[Coulomb]]'s monumental researches began to be published in 1785
	- Marked the beginning of quantitative research in electricity and magnetism worldwide
- 1864 [[Maxwell]] published his famous paper on a dynamical theory of the electromagnetic field
- 1888 [[Hertz]] published his discovery of transverse electromagnetic waves, which propagated at the same speed as light
	- placed Maxwell's theory on a firm experimental footing
- Since the 1960s there has been a true revolution in our understanding of the basic forces and constituents of matter
- Classic electrodynamics rests within the *standard model*
	- standard model gives a coherent description of electromagnetic, weak, and strong interactions based on fundamental constituents -- quarks and leptons -- interacting via force carriers -- photons, W and Z bosons, and gluons.
## 1.1 Maxwell Equations in Vacuum, Fields, and Sources
The equations governing electromagnetics phenomena are the Maxwell equations,

where for external sources in vacuum, D = ∈<sub>0</sub>E and B = μ<sub>0</sub>H. The first two equations then become
