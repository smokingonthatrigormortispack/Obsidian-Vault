The Neural Computation Unit pursues the dual goals of developing robust and flexible learning algorithms and elucidating the brainâ€™s mechanisms for robust and flexible learning. Our specific focus is on how the brain realizes reinforcement learning, in which an agent, biological or artificial, learns novel behaviors in uncertain environments by exploration and reward feedback. We combine top-down, computational approaches and bottom-up, neurobiological approaches to achieve these goals.

Subject: Request for Unpaid Science Lab Internship

Dear Dr. Doya,

I am writing to inquire about the possibility of an internship in your lab. As a high school student, I am eager to gain hands-on experience with scientific research in a lab environment.  
  
I have been interested in your lab's work in adaptive systems. As an aspiring mechanical/aerospace engineer for NASA, I want to use machine learning to further develop rovers and other extraterrestrial devices.  
  
With a strong foundation in technical skills and a hardy work-ethic, I believe I can make a contribution to your ongoing research projects. That being said, I understand that the lab environment is on a different level from anything I've previously worked in. I'm committed to learning more and growing both as a student of science and as a future member of the workforce.
  
I am available to intern whenever is convenient for your team, and will be able to work with you until my academic year starts on August 22nd. I am flexible with scheduling and any guidelines or requirements you may have.  
  
I have attached my resume/CV for your review, providing further details on my academic background, research experience, and skills. I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to discuss my potential contribution to your lab in person or online.  
  
Thank you for considering my application. I am excited about the prospect of working with your research team and gaining valuable insight into what a professional scientific environment looks like.  
  
Sincerely,  
Julian Hong
