- Summary:: today at work i found out that until i procure research insurance, i can't do any lab work. this is a pain in the ass, as i need the insurance from my school and my school isn't being particularly understanding rn (shoutouts to mr pallmann). i'll have to make some adjustments and see if i can get this insurance. i need it, by all means necessary. in any case, i attended a meeting michael invited me to today and it's fucking complicated like all the other shit there, but it was fun. i went to gym after work today and had to rush all my shit in 30 minutes. it's better than nothing, and i'm glad i went, but i was so annoyed and pissed the entire session. i was in a rush and hurt myself too, so i'm angry about that as well. also dad texted me today, and we're meeting up after work tomorrow. i guess i should finish that letter.
