- Summary:: hey fucker! long time to no see. last time we talked was in october, which is hashtag crazy. anyways, two big take away: one, i finished college applications yesterday (woohoo!), meaning i have time to read, go to the gym, have e-sex. whatever i want really! <br>second, i'm starting to read daily. i came across this post that say. Holy shit! That's a lot of books. I'm going to try and read 10-20 pages every day and see if that gets me to 10-20 books this year. wish me luck!
