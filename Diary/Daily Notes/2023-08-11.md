- Summary:: today i went to see the barbie movie with aika and mitsuo. it was pretty good. i think the message was good and i don't know why the politics are so dramatized. the gym was closed today so i went to obbligatos to munch out (note: their steak is to die for, and i will steal their recipe). i got home early so now I should probably work.

## 💡 New Discoveries
- NewDiscovery:: Obbligato steak is to die for, get it everytime
