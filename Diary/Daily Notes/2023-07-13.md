# Diary
Today I played Skullgirls with my friend and loved one [[Joshua Lee]]. Honestly, I don't particularly like this Joshua Lee very much. He is quite the odd individual. Odd. Very odd. I also showed him my Obsidian workflow and showed him how workflowpilled I am. I mogged him with my efficiency and productivity. I'm literally productivitymaxxing right now.
