- Summary:: Like a dumbass, I woke up at 10 AM and didn't do jack shit until basically 2. I was working on Neovim trying to get the configs to work. Getting the init.lua to work is a bitch, especially since the tutorial I was following made me set up everything like shit. Regardless, I got Pomo set up and almost got Obsidian incorporation working? not really, i need to still figure out obsidian.nvim and the zenmode focus stuff. but still, good progress. <br> In any case, I have to work on the Champloo shorts because we finally finished the Powerlifting video and we want to mass upload today. So I have to get that sorted.
