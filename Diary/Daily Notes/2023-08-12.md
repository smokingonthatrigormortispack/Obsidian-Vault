- Summary:: today i had to go back to the theatre at 10 am to get my weightlifting shoes. they were clean and nice, and i'm super grateful to that dude. we went to walk around chatan, which was pretty sucky. i had a kind of shitty lunch (except the guy there was cool), mom went around shopping and i was bogged down from that lunch and bored from shopping. then we went to the gym, where i brought my mom to do a light workout. she really sucks at this, and if she even indicates 1% of my genetic potential, i am fucked. her lifts today were 35 kg 5x5 deadlift, 22.5 kg 5x5 squat, 20 kg 5x5 bench.
