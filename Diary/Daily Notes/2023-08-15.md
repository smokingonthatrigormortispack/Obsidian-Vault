- Summary:: today i volunteered at the first session of SoS. I helped Mr. Lloyd teach the 5-6th grade students how to code Arduino. It's kind of rough cause I don't even speak Japanese, but I made it work. Jacque debriefed me about what work I have to do and the nature of the sample he's working on. Short story, hBN is cool but also a bitch. i'm going to have to work on sample creation tomorrow. also i went to a party today and drank fake champaign (i'm not 20 yet), and for a lot of it it was pretty awkward and idk if it was just me but it felt pretty awkward until i talked to this one guy named Justus (pronounced youst uss) and he's pretty cool he's 22 and a grad student and ETH Zurich. He's pretty cool but i think he thinks im annoying, and i think a lot of the other students think that too. they're kind of right.
