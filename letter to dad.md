~~~### Dear dad,

Writing this letter is tough.

It's tough because, more than anything, I just want to brush off whatever happened in the past. It's what I've always done since I was a little boy. I'd just pretend what happened never happened, because only more trouble would come if I dwelled on it.

Before I say what I'm about to say, I couldn't be more grateful for what you've provided me in life. I wouldn't be miles ahead of my classmates or even have a chance of getting into MIT if it wasn't for you.

But for as long as I can remember, I've known something about the both of us, something we share as a father and son.

We are both vitriolic, angry, and violent people. This isn't either of our faults, it was just how we were born. 

In one of your text messages to me, you mentioned being uncomfortable by my "violent behavior." With all due respect, where do you think that came from? From my video games? From mom? From teenage hormonal angst?

It came from you dad. Forget behaviorism and Bandura, it was destined to be that way. Up to 50% of aggression materializes due to genetics; it's more likely than not that this is what was meant for us. To be dangerous to others is in our DNA.

I only became what you are, and to me, that's fine. I've come to accept who I am the same way I've come to accept who you are.

Remember how I made everyone at that dance session uncomfortable? How my aggression made everyone, including you, uneasy? That's what it was like being around you. Especially when I was younger, saying or doing anything around you felt like playing hop scotch in a minefield.

But I'm not that scared little boy anymore. I can be angry and violent too now. If being around someone like that makes you uncomfortable, I'm sorry. But to me, we're just being even.

It's not something I want to talk about in depth. In all honesty, everything I just said only scratches the surface. But I'm willing to sweep it under the rug and return to what's normal, like I always have. Except now it's time for you to do the same.

Best,

Julian Hong~~~

Dear Dad,

I know you've been waiting for this letter, but it's taken me some time to properly write it.

There are two things I have to say above all else.

First, I don't see you as a money bag, and I never have. Maybe you've never seen it that way, but I've always been hesitant to ask you to buy anything. Honestly, when mom tells me that she can't buy something and asks me to ask you for it, I usually just don't bother.

Second, I'm so grateful for everything you've done and provided for me in life. I would not be half the student, person, or scientist I am today if it wasn't for you. You're probably also the reason I got a 4 in AP Calc BC and AP Physics Mech (or I'm a genius). 

I think ultimately both of us are very explosive people, but I also think that we both do our best. I know you'll get mad at me again, and I know I'll return the favor. But at the end of the day, you're my dad, and nothing changes that.

See you at work big man.

Best,

Julian
