The Human Developmental Neurobiology Unit investigates the nature, causes, and management of ADHD. Unit members study why children diagnosed with ADHD respond differently to reinforcement, and they work with colleagues overseas conducting fMRI and drug studies to explore the disorderâ€™s underlying neurobiology. The unit is also studying the social problem solving skills of children with ADHD and developing a skills program for Japanese parents dealing with ADHD.

Subject: Request for Unpaid Science Lab Internship

Dear Dr. Tripp,

I am writing to inquire about the possibility of an internship in your lab. As a high school student, I am eager to gain hands-on experience with scientific research in a lab environment.  
  
Ever since middle school, I've been fascinated with psychology, specifically psychology concerning neurodivergents. It seems to me that my generation is more cognizant of their psychological abnormalities than any generation before. Conditions such as autism and ADHD are finally receiving the attention and care that they deserve. Given that many of those close to me struggle with autism and ADHD, I wish to work in your lab to better understand neurodivergence and how I can better assist those in my life who are neurodivergent.

I understand that a professional research unit is levels beyond what high school can prepare you for, but I am adamant in my commitment to learn the skills and traits I need to be able to contribute to your unit. In addition, I have much experience working with children, and I often play with and keep the kids at OIST's SAP program company.
  
I am available to intern whenever is convenient for your team, and will be able to work with you until my academic year starts on August 22nd. I am flexible with scheduling and any guidelines or requirements you may have.  
  
I have attached my resume/CV for your review, providing further details on my academic background, research experience, and skills. I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to discuss my potential contribution to your lab in person or online.  
  
Thank you for considering my application. I am excited about the prospect of working with your research team and gaining valuable insight into what a professional scientific environment looks like.  
  
Sincerely,  
Julian Hong
