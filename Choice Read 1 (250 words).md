The Martian, although seemingly complex do to the in depth science used throughout the book, is ultimately a very simple book. It is a story about perseverance and the human desire to help one another. It is one thing to say, "humans persevere against the odds and help on another." It is another thing entirely to take us through the ups and downs of survival, and see the conflicts that happen behind closed doors that lead to true human kindness. Mark Watney throughout various phases of the story transitions between varying degrees of optimism, and the chief decision makers at NASA are always at odds about how or if it's possible to save Mark Watney. The Martian displays literary merit by exploring deep themes throughout the book and using multiple characters to examine these themes from multiple perspectives.

The theme of human aid is one of the most hotly contested in the novel. The two executives of NASA, Teddy and Mitch, seem to be constantly butting heads. But their conflict does not lie in a difference of personalities, or some drama from their past, but a key difference in their perception of human aid. Teddy believes that the lives of the few should never be put at risk for the lives of the many, even despite the desires of the many. Mitch has the opposite idea, that if people want to give their absolute everything to help the people love, nothing should stop them. It is through this ideological conflict that provides the story "literary merit." Instead of just declaring a moral or idea, The Martian explores said moral's ins and outs before resolving on its stance.
